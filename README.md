# Windowed Green function method for wave scattering by periodic arrays

This repository is solves the scattering problem by incident planewaves over a periodic domain in 2D and 3D for line arrays and surface arrays. 
The full-code is written in Julia and heavily relies on WaveProp packages (https://github.com/WaveProp) for geometry assembling, mesh construction and boundary integral equations discretizations.

WavePropBase and Nystrom dependencies should be first installed.

The methodology has been presented and succesfully validated for the 2D problem with L-periodic line array in:

## Warning!
Although the methodology converges for 2D it has not been fully tested and corrected for 3D. This corresponds to future work.
